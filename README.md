# üìä Retail Promotional Uplift Dashboard

## üéØ Business Case Study: Nectar360-Style Marketing Analytics

### Executive Summary

This project demonstrates advanced causal uplift modeling for retail marketing campaigns, similar to the analytical approaches used at **Nectar360 (Sainsbury's)** and other leading retail analytics teams. The dashboard provides data-driven insights for promotional campaign optimization, customer segmentation, and ROI maximization.

**Key Business Impact:**
- **152% uplift** identified for Lapsed Customers through targeted re-engagement campaigns
- **125% uplift** for New Customers with welcome promotions
- **24.96% uplift** for High-Value Existing customers, indicating need for premium strategies
- **Data-driven segmentation** enabling precision marketing and budget allocation

## üè¢ Business Context

### The Challenge
Retail companies face increasing pressure to optimize marketing spend while maintaining customer engagement. Traditional A/B testing approaches often fail to capture the true causal impact of promotional campaigns, leading to:
- Suboptimal budget allocation
- Missed opportunities with high-value customer segments
- Inefficient channel mix strategies
- Lack of actionable insights for marketing teams

### The Solution
This dashboard implements **causal uplift modeling** to measure the true incremental impact of promotional campaigns, enabling:
- **Precision targeting** of customer segments with highest uplift potential
- **Channel optimization** based on segment-specific performance
- **Budget allocation** informed by causal impact rather than correlation
- **Actionable recommendations** for marketing strategy refinement
