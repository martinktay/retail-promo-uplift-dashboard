## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset Overview

The `rfm_enriched.csv` contains real retail transaction data with RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis components:

- **Customer Data:** customer_id, customer_tier (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum)
- **Transaction Data:** purchase_amount, purchase_date, transaction_type (Full Price/Discount/Return)
- **Channel & Product:** channel (Online/In-store), product_category
- **Derived Features:** RFM scores, customer segments, promotional exposure

## Methodology

### Uplift Modeling Approach
We employ a two-model approach for causal inference:
1. **Treatment Model:** Predicts purchase probability for treated customers
2. **Control Model:** Predicts purchase probability for control customers
3. **Uplift Score:** Difference between treatment and control predictions

### Segmentation Strategy
- **RFM Segments:** Champions, Loyal Customers, At Risk, Can't Lose, Lost
- **Customer Tiers:** Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum
- **Transaction Types:** Full Price, Discount, Return
- **Channels:** Online, In-store
